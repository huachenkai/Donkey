            <p>The first time I officially participated in the community activity,

            <p>The store just opened the activity is quite strong ~ 
                recharge activity should be very cost-effective</p><br/>
            <img src="/Donkey1/Galleria/images/r2.png"><br/>
            <p>Store space is large, the height is higher, 
                carry empty out of the second floor, the space is large 
                establishments or personally, I prefer a little more than 
                half the store basically full occupancy, the feeling is very popular with yao</p><br/>

            <p>Small makings self - service area, the variety of makings is very complete, 
                the taste follows own feeling to go, how can eat spicy not to come to oil dish</p><br/>
            <img src="/Donkey1/Galleria/images/r6.png"><br/>
            <p>There are all kinds of vegetables, balls, pasta, seafood and bean products, and small cold dishes</p><br/>
